    <h1>The Eternal Goodness of Dogs üêæ</h1>
    <div class="poem">
      <p>
Dogs, oh wondrous companions of humankind, guardians of hearth and heart, creatures who walk beside us through ages long forgotten, and in moments freshly born. In their eyes, we glimpse loyalty undiluted by time; in their paws, we trace the path of trust that no storm can wash away. This humble poem, stretching a thousand words, is not merely ink arranged upon paper, but a hymn, a celebration, and a call to those who have yet to understand: the dog is not just an animal, it is a living promise of love, courage, and joy.  
      </p>

      <p>
The goodness of dogs is not measured in gold or jewels, but in the countless heartbeats they share freely. From the village lanes where shepherds watch their flocks, to the grand cities where children run across marble squares, the dog remains constant ‚Äî a silent teacher of faith. When the world doubts you, a dog believes. When silence consumes you, a dog listens. When despair knocks at your soul‚Äôs door, a dog, with wagging tail, bursts it open with laughter and life.  
      </p>

      <p>
They are the poets who do not write but live, the guardians who do not wear armor yet defend, the healers who do not study medicine yet cure with presence. To watch a dog rest is to see peace embodied. To watch it play is to witness joy unchained. Their goodness is not a fragile thing that comes and goes; it is an eternal river, flowing without end, refreshing all who kneel to drink.  
      </p>

      <p>
Dogs are the music of everyday life. The rhythm of paws on wooden floors, the gentle sigh as they sleep by your bed, the sudden bark announcing a visitor ‚Äî all these weave a melody that fills homes with warmth. A dog‚Äôs greeting, tail spinning like a wheel of happiness, outshines any gift wrapped in velvet. What jewel in the crown of kings compares to the sparkle in a dog‚Äôs eyes when you return after a long day?  
      </p>

      <p>
But their goodness is not only in joy ‚Äî it is in sacrifice. How many stories tell of dogs who stood against wolves to protect sheep, who leapt into rivers to save children, who waited faithfully at train stations for masters who never returned? Each tale is more than legend: it is testament to the spirit that beats inside these noble beings. Their hearts are not measured in size but in courage. And every time a dog gives its life to protect another, humanity is reminded of what selflessness truly means.  
      </p>

      <p>
For the lonely, dogs are friends; for the weak, guardians; for the broken, healers. Science tells us their presence lowers blood pressure, eases anxiety, and lengthens life. Yet no science can fully measure the unseen miracles: the way a grieving widow finds reason to smile because of her pup, or how a lost child finds safety guided by a faithful hound. Dogs transform silence into comfort, loneliness into company, fear into courage.  
      </p>

      <p>
And so, let this poem flow like a river, pouring gratitude and admiration. Let each word be a petal in a garland of praise placed at the feet of these faithful companions. Let every reader feel the pull, the magnetism, the irresistible call to love dogs not as property but as partners, not as beasts but as brothers. They enrich us without demanding riches, they teach us without demanding classrooms, and they love us without demanding perfection.  
      </p>

      <p>
Oh traveler of life, if you have never known a dog‚Äôs friendship, seek it! For once found, you shall never be the same. Their goodness is a lamp that never extinguishes, a song that never ends, a bond that even death cannot sever. Long after their paws no longer press the earth, the echo of their loyalty remains, guiding us, comforting us, reminding us of what it means to love without condition.  
      </p>

      <p>
Thus, this poem stretches onward, word upon word, echo upon echo, carrying the truth through a thousand breaths: dogs are good, dogs are noble, dogs are the companions we did not deserve but were blessed to have. Cherish them, celebrate them, and let your heart forever be shaped by their boundless, eternal goodness.  
      </p>
